# Mixed_Messages
This is the Codecademy Mixed Messages Project. I took the inspriational quote approach.

## How to run?
To run this project follow this instructions:

* Download the files as a ZIP file
* Open the index.html file or run the files using Node.js

I will potentially look at hosting the file on a GitHub page.
